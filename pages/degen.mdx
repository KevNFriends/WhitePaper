# ðŸ”Ž More than a Degen Project

**Kev Nâ€™ Friends are here to create value.**

The recipe for value is complex and flexible, especially in the NFT space. We recognize the different requirements for value at different stages of a typical project, and have created a long-term plan that caters to all different forms of value, including airdrops, rewards, merchandise, marketing and most importantly the value of personal connection. 

Our team had months of work put into two other NFT projects before we decided to put the original Pixel Kevin project together. So why have we chosen to focus all our attention on a project that took less than a week to create? To put it as simply as possible, the potential. There is something to be said for a project that rides on the premise of degeneracy alone. However there is so much more potential for projects evolved out of a counter-culture narrative, and this is what we intend to build upon. 

**Degenerate Art + Counter Culture Narrative + Flexible Value Creation = Kev N' Friends**

# 📖 Project Origin

Pixel Kevins is the first launch by Forsaken Labs. 

As a team we have seen the space evolve over the past year, having gotten involved in NFT building and collecting in mid 2021. 
We witnessed rugs, dissapointing art, culture shifts and everything that has evolved within the web3 space.

We have always held a passion for creating funny and unique art in the traditional world, so naturally we attempted to build out a collection as a team.
As any artist-at-heart may relate to, there was immense joy in seeing your ideas take shape in 3D renders or animations, being transformed from a rough sketch with pen and paper into a deeply detailed piece of art. Months flew by as we accumulated two complete collections worth of art that we were felt proud to deploy. However when it came to launching these projects we had difficulty. We had difficulty building a long-term plan around them. Difficulty finding meaning behind the art we spent months creating because we unknowingly were expecting the meaning to fall into place after the art was complete. This time sunk into learning the ins and outs of the generative art process was far from a waste, as we learned the requirements for constructing a project that is rich in potential and meaning.

Pixel Kevins were completed in 5 days. The months of practice honing our skills and cutting our teeth on other projects allowed us to code, design, and generate this full collection in a little under a weeks time. Unlike our other projects though, this collection had a meaning to it. To us this launch symbolized a counter-culture within the NFT space. After all, what is a degen project if not a middle-finger to the venture-capitalist-backed shill projects that overpromise in nearly all aspects?

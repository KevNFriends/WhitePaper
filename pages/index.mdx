# Introducing Kev N' Friends

**LAB REPORT #C69-420XX**

Here at Forsaken Labs we take the utmost care to ensure all metaverse portals are functioning safely and efficiently! It has come to our attention that one of our interns, I will resist the urge to mention any names... (Donnie) may have failed to turn on the Z-Deflector around the lab... and set the alarm... and clean up the microwave when he is done using it...

We aren't upset, we recognize that not all are created equal, or created with the same amount of brain cells. The intern in question (Donnie) has been reprimanded and will stripped of his/her microwave priveledges.

On the 18th of April, 2022, we received surveillance footage of an unidentified Zingy (Alien-creature from broke into our lab and openned the Pixel-verse portal, allowing Kev to escape his multiverse and find his way into the Loopy-verse.

Kev was getting a little lonely in the metaverse...

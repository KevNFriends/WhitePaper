# Introducing Kev N' Friends

**Kev N’ Friends are here to create value.**

The recipe for value is complex and flexible, especially in the NFT space. We recognize the different requirements for value at different stages of a typical project, and have created a long-term plan that caters to all different forms of value, including airdrops, rewards, merchandise, marketing and most importantly the value of personal connection. 

Our team had months of work put into two other NFT projects before we decided to put the original Pixel Kevin project together. So why have we chosen to focus all our attention on a project that took less than a week to create? To put it as simply as possible, the potential.

As lifetime artists and creators, we shared the lesson learned by many newcomers entering NFTs, that the value of an NFT isn’t only determined by the quality of the art. We always keep our understanding of the potential of this project and the culture it represents in every step of our work.

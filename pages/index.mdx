# Introducing Kev N' Friends

**LAB REPORT - LOOPY FRIENDS #C69-420XX**

Here at Forsaken Labs we take the utmost care to ensure all metaverse portals are functioning safely and efficiently! It has come to our attention that one of our interns, I will resist the urge to mention any names... (Donnie) may have failed to turn on the Z-Deflector around the lab... and set the alarm... and clean up the microwave when he is done using it...

We aren't upset, we recognize that not all lab workers are created equal, or created with the same amount of brain cells. The intern in question (Donnie) has been reprimanded and will stripped of his/her microwave priveledges.

On the 18th of April, 2022, we received surveillance footage of an unidentified Zingy (Alien-creature from planet Zeptune) broke into our lab and opened the Pixel-verse portal, allowing Kev to escape his hetaverse and find his way into the Loopy-verse. 

The creature known as Kev seems to be enjoying his time in the Loopy-verse with his new friends, according to the surveillance recordings him and his many friends riding around on absurb vehicles listening to strangely groovy tunes. 

I just hope this is the last time those damn Zingies break into our lab to disturb our experiments... god help us if they manage to break open the Goob-verse portal!

Anyways, we are working on restoring the broken Loopy-portal to get Kev back to his own metaverse. Other than that all is well inside the Labs! The Zuk is running, the portals are powered, the Z-Deflector is engaged and I ate Donnies lunch!

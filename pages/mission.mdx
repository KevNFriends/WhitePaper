# Our Mission

What does it take to solidify a meme?

Trends and cultures are fast moving within Web3. To anchor a style or project into the history books we as a community are writing it takes great effort, skill, and bulletproof values to build that project upon.

Our mission is to:

* **Uphold** the values held by our community.

* **Reciprocate** the excitement and wonder within our holders through passion and hard work.

* **Prove** to you that our drive and creativity are our most powerful tools as a team.

* **Spark** your creative mind and embrace the wonder and imagination in all of us.

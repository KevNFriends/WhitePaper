### Who can vote or start a proposal in Snapshot?
Anyone with a wallet address holding $GIFT tokens will be eligible to vote on elfDAO proposals, as well as create new proposals.

## 2. Legal and Structural Questions

### What does the legal structure look like?
We’ve partnered with [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org), a 501(c)(3) U.S. PBC that specializes in facilitating the donation of digital assets to charities. They’ve committed to making sure that every bit of ETH we raise (other than the 2.5% going to overhead costs) can be distributed to the charities we vote on; whether they take crypto or USD.

### Do you have your own legal entity?
elfDAO is an unincorporated nonprofit association as our purpose is charitable in nature.

### Are contributions to elfDAO tax-deductible?
**No.** elfDAO is not a registered non-profit and all contributions to elfDAO are made voluntarily in exchange for $GIFT tokens. If you’d prefer to make a tax-deductible donation to elfDAO, please contact the team at [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org) via [Discord](http://discord.gg/endaoment) or [email](mailto:admin+elfdao@endaoment.org).

## Juicebox and $GIFT Tokens Questions

### Why are we using Juicebox?
Juicebox lets us receive your donations directly to our smart contract. In return, you’ll receive tokens in your wallet proportional to your donation amount! It is a great tool for the community to see the funding project, and it’s easy to distribute funds through the distribution mechanisms. Learn more about Juicebox [here](https://juicebox.money/#/).

### Is there any value to the $GIFT token?

**No.** You are receiving a governance token. Your contribution to elfDAO is a donation with no expectation of profit. Governance tokens give you voting power within elfDAO, meaning that you’ll help decide how our funds are spent. The tokens’ sole purpose is for governance and voting rights for elfDAO’s use of funds.

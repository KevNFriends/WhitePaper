# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. DAO Questions

### Who is in charge at elfDAO?
The core team coordinates to drive key efforts across the DAO, and lay the structure for governance to enable DAO community-driven decisions. The people listed as signers on the Multisig are responsible for the transfer of funds. 

### How will proposals and voting work?
We will be utilizing [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), a decentralized governance built for DAOs like us. We will be starting our Snapshot process by putting forth our initial governance proposal which includes parameters on governance on January 2nd, 2022. 

### Who can vote or start a proposal in Snapshot?
Anyone with a wallet address holding $GIFT tokens will be eligible to vote on elfDAO proposals, as well as create new proposals. 

## 2. Legal and Structural Questions

### What does the legal structure look like?
We’ve partnered with [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org), a 501(c)(3) U.S. PBC that specializes in facilitating the donation of digital assets to charities. They’ve committed to making sure that every bit of ETH we raise can be distributed to the charities we vote on; whether they take crypto or USD.

### Do you have your own legal entity?
**No.** The DAO does not plan to own any fiat or physical assets, so there is no need for our own entity. Conversion from digital assets to fiat for the purposes of charitable donations will be handled by our partner, [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org).

### Are contributions to elfDAO tax-deductible?
**No.** elfDAO is not a registered non-profit and all contributions to elfDAO are made voluntarily in exchange for $GIFT tokens. If you’d prefer to make a tax-deductible donation to elfDAO, please contact the team at [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org) via [Discord](http://discord.gg/endaoment) or [email](mailto:admin+elfdao@endaoment.org). 

## Juicebox and $GIFT Tokens Questions

### Why are we using Juicebox?
Juicebox lets us receive your donations directly to our smart contract. In return, you’ll receive tokens in your wallet proportional to your donation amount! It is a great tool for the community to see the funding project, and it’s easy to distribute funds through the distribution mechanisms. Learn more about Juicebox [here](https://juicebox.money/#/). 

### Is there any value to the $GIFT token? 

**No.** You are receiving a governance token. Your contribution to elfDAO is a donation with no expectation of profit. Governance tokens give you voting power within elfDAO, meaning that you’ll help decide how our funds are spent. The tokens’ sole purpose is for governance and voting rights for elfDAO’s use of funds.

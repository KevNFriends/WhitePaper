# Let's build Web3 culture on giving.

**The Christmas season can be an especially difficult time for many.** COVID has put an even larger strain on families with financial difficulties. Single parents, in particular, struggle to afford gifts for their children. Many kids will not get Christmas gifts this year, but we can change that. Let's spread a little more holiday joy in this special time.

  **What if we created a DAO to fund charities/projects that provide people with memorable Christmas gifts?**

For those who do not understand what a DAO is, a DAO (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a kind of internet-native co-op that is governed with cryptocurrency tokens and blockchain-based ‘smart contracts’ instead of traditional corporate boards and bylaws ([New York Times, 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/crypto-constitution-sothebys.html)). In short, it is a “financial flash mob”, or in other words, "chat rooms with bank accounts".

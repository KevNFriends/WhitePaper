# 🗺 Kev N' Friends Roadmap


**🤝 Trust US**

We know our worth, and we know what we are capable as a team and family (a literal family). 
We don't want to provide bullshit, unattainable goals in hopes of tricking you into thinking we will be doing things we have no intention of doing.

Some targets that we are already looking into:
* Otherside Integration + Land Purchase
* 2D Animated skit show, showcasing our characters
* Collaborations
* Marketing
* Merchansise and Rewards for Holders

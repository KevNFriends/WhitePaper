#Project Origin

Pixel Kevins were the first launch by Forsaken Labs. To us this launch symbolized a counter-culture within the NFT space. The over-embellished art, empty promises and blatant greed by some projects provide all the motivation needed to build a project that counters this toxic behavior wherever possible. 

We created Pixel Kevins in a little under 5 days. No initial roadmap, no long term plans, and no pressure from holders.

# ðŸš™ Loopy Friends

Isn't life better when you don't take it so seriously? Who hasn't wanted to take your static 2D or 3D NFT for a bit of a ride through the metaverse at some point? 
It's time to take a step up from a plain old jpeg and get a little loopy ðŸ™ƒ

Buckle your seatbelts and get some popcorn, because thanks to our intern who didn't know how to properly secure a portal, Kev has wandered into the Loopy-verse to join his friends Spanky, Clanky and Zingy for some serious fun.

* Brand New Characters
* Looping Animations
